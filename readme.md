#Simple Task List Program

The goal of this program was to create a simple tasklist to easily keep track of tasks.

**THIS IS BY NO MEANS FINISHED**  I still have a lot of work to do, but this is a functioning program.  I will work on it as time permits.  
  ---
Here is a list of things I still need to get done.  Keep in mind this is a rough sketch, I may find more that I can do to make it better.  

##todo:  
- clean up headers for the tasklist menu files
- clean up code/beautify it
- go over it and check if anything can be more efficient
- other tasks, as I find them  
 --- 
Here are some possible additions/extensions to the program I want to, or am thinking about adding.  If you wish to suggest your own, feel free to do so:

##possible additions:
- ability to delete all tasks on a date

---
##Dependencies:  
  
- 64-bit linux
- C++ libraries: NCurses and Boost
